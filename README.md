# godot-unofficial-demo-projects-v3
Sample unofficial GODOT projects by Pete Goodwin (based on tutorials from documentation, Q&A and videos) for V3 of GODOT.
These are all works in progress.
## breakout
Very basic version of breakout. There's still an issue with the speed of the ball.
## cookies
Match 3 type game
## crates
Simple crates you can fire a ball at. Click to the right of the crates. You have three balls.
## fps
First person shooter: shows FPS, textured floor and plain blue balls
## Menus
Menu sample - heh, never done menus with Godot yet!
## plugins
A version of GDNative simple C plugin (with corrected source code). Tried building it with VS 2017.
## TD2
Tower Defense game in C#. You can see a video of it running here: https://youtu.be/U-c7m47kb10
## Busstops
A game where an elk scouts for bus stops!
